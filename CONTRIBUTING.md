Thanks for your interest in contributing to UMockMe. I really hope to build the best Mock Draft Engine out there.  The existing engines are all so basic and do not offer the customization and flexibility I think the space deserves for a TRUE Draftnick.
I hope this project allows you to pursue your passion both in Software Engineering as well as the NFL Draft.

This is my first crack at creating an opensource project so any recommendations as to process etc (Including this CONTRIBUTING File), are welcome and encouraged.

For Defects, Feature Recommendations, etc please use the Issues in this GitHub Repository.

COMING SOON:
I will be setting up more information with regards to how to build and test this project.   In order to do this, I first have to make changes to how we get our data becuase the NFL.com Site that I used to screen scrape from is no longer really available...

Contact:
You can contact me directly if you wish. We can do a Zoom to get you up to speed, discuss vision, etc.
