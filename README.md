UMockMe Site
This application is for entertainment purposes. It is intended to emulate the NFL Draft each spring. This is NOT to be confused with Fantasy Draft Emulators or Fantasy Mock Draft Tools. This emulates the ACTUAL Draft and tries to predict who the actual teams will pick when the draft occurs.

Many People feverishly watch, study and research the incoming draft prospects and their teams. This is a great way for DRAFT Fans to run through various scenarios as a way to determine which players might be available when their team is on the clock each round.

The Basic of the Site:
Home Page:
user can either create a free account here OR they can simply utilize the Default Draft Engine to have UMockMe Run Through the Entire Draft (1 round at a time) and Automatically Pick who WE think woudl be the most likely picks for each team.  This default algorithm takes into consideration many different factos; Team Needs, Player Rankings, some degree of randomization.

Custom Draft:
IF a user creates a free profile they get access to the Custom Draft which allows THEM to pick every single player of each round OR to have UMockMe Pick. The picks are handled 1 pick at a time as opposed to an entire round at a time, so the User can walk through every single pick 1 at a time determining if He\She wants to make the or if UMockMe Should make it for them.

This still uses the default algorithm used above, but allows the user to pick when they want to.

With an Account, the user also has the ability to modify the Pick Logic by editing details about Draft Prospects; they can tweak the player ratings (increase or decrease a players rating), they can add information about Character issues a player might have that UMockMe has not accountd for, and they can indicate specific teams that each player may have met with. Individual Team Meetings are a very strong indication that a team is interested in a specific player.

Users will also have the ability to modify Team Details, most specifically they can provide info on which schools an NFL team typically recruits from. The Pittsburgh Steelers, for example, tend to favor players for Ohio State and from University of Pittsburgh. Some teams may shy away from specific schools such as University of Miama due to the offensive scheme a team runs, poor discipline at a school or for various othe reasons. All this can be noted at the team level and then the algorithm will consider that wnen drafting
